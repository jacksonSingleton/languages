# てｰForm for Giving
---
- Giving verbs: あげる、もらう、くれる can be combined with another verb's て形 to show directionality of someone doing something for someone else.
- The giving/receiving circle's inside and outside principles still apply here

> [!example] Subjective Differences
> 私が父に教えてもらった
> I(subject) was taught *by* my father
> ---
> 父が私に教えてくれた
> My father(subject) taught me

- The speaker is usually implied by くれる statements without an explicit recipient
- When the て form is used in an auxiliary context, ないで is the expected ending for negatives as opposed to なくて

# Imperative Form
---
- True imperative form, often sounds rude and is more like a command
- 一段 verbs take on the ろ ending
- 五段 verbs take on their ending's え sound

> [!example]
> 見ろ！
> Look!
> ---
> 殺せ
> Kill!
> ---
> 切れ
> Cut!
> ---
> 買え
> Buy!

- Archaic form exists for 一段 with よ ending
	- e.g. 食べよ　→　Eat

# で、では、じゃ
---
- Denotes means or the location where an action occurs
- Contraction of にて
	- May appear in formal settings
- で may also appear as if it's the て form of だ. It assumes typical usage of the て form, except it works with nouns or nominalized words

> [!example]
> 中学生で一人暮らしはできない
> *To be a middle schooler __and__ live alone is not possible*

## では
- Compound particle between で as the case marker and は as the topic particle
- では indicates that the statement following the particle applies to the context and circumstance of the noun attached to では
