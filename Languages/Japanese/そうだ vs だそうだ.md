## 〜そう
そうだ implies "seems" or "appears". This is *heavily driven by its form*

"It seems ~"
*This point is about **making an observation**

> [!warning]
> When using い-adjectives, the final い is dropped 
> 暑い→暑そうだ *Hot → Seems hot*
> #### Negation
> When い-adjectives are negated, the final い is also dropped from ない and さ is added as a link
> 	暑くない →

## 〜だそうだ
*This point is about __repeating information__*
"I heard that ~"

## Differing Between the Two

### Verbs
> Repeating information takes the unaltered form of the verb:

降るそうだ *It heard that it's raining*
降りそうだ *It seems like it's raining*

### い-adjectives
寒いそうだ *I heard that it's cold*
寒そうだ *It seems cold*

### な-adjectives and Nouns
綺麗だそうだ *I heard that it was beautiful*
綺麗そうだ *It seems clean*

The gist is that *plain form + __そうだ__*  implies that you're repeating information, where as the *stem + __そうだ__* implies that you've observing information
