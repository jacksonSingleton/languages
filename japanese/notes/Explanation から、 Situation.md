- から can be used as "because" when added to then end of a sentence
	- e.g. 朝ごはんを食べませんでした。忙しかったですから
	- *I didn't have breakfast. (Because) I was busy*
- We can conjoin by changing the sentence structure to `Explanation + から, Situation`


# Xから、Y

- Conjoining the sentences in this way functions more like a "therefore" sentence in English.

> [!example]
> 明日試験があるから、今晩勉強します
> *We have a test tomorrow, therefore, I will study this evening*
> 
> 寒かったから、出かけませんでした
> *Because it was cold, we didn't go out*

- Before the conjunction から, long and short forms may be used. However, it is inaccurate to use the long form before the conjunction in a sentence ending with short form.
- Long form before から is seen as more polite and is found in request and suggestion sentences.

> [!danger] Important
>X  寒かったですから、出かけなかった

>Long form can't be used in explanation unless entire phrase is polite.
>Short form can always be used in the explanation.
