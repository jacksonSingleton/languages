- Category: #articles
- Summary: な-adjectives are a type of adjective in Japanese that describe nouns and are different from い-adjectives. They use the particle な to connect to nouns and can also function as nouns themselves. Unlike い-adjectives, な-adjectives do not change form for tense and use specific forms to indicate past or negative meanings.

## Highlights
- The main function of な-adjectives is to describe nouns. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jvzjkhj0ssgq0s8whg74a14j))
- earn their name from な, which is used to attach a な-adjective to a noun. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jw0dg1tavvdzmqy4q73ngrtg))
- Unlike い-adjectives, な-adjectives cannot be conjugated to show tense—present or past—and truth value—positive or negative. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jvzjn1c508jmpfkqh732017r))
- why they are often called “nominal (noun-like) adjectives” or “adjectival nouns” in linguistics. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jvzjn8za0wxfpx6zhvtjvgse))
- Just like nouns, な-adjectives can take [だ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/da) or [です](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/desu) to indicate that they are in the present tense. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jvzjnv4t58a56rjc6h574hgy))
- When you want to indicate that the quality described by the な-adjective is in the past, you’ll use [だった](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/datta) or [でした](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/deshita) to make it happen. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jw0djnpdcmh69p4mwm9fbf38))
- This means that the quality was true before, but is no longer true at this point in time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jw0dk0dqsaw209ast6ytqsz3))
- Making a な-adjective negative tells us that the quality described by the word is **not** true. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jw0dzw66arf0db9kw4skchpf))
- such as [じゃない and ではない](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/janai-dewanai/). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jw0e0fdfffjst5vf2y3mkyhr))
- When a な-adjective comes at the end of a sentence (or more specifically, in the predicate of a clause), it describes the subject of the sentence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jw0e8hmc88vfthk11ff6sw64))
- In this case, the な-adjective still describes the subject, you just have to figure out what that subject is. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jw0fv1kzq3n3c85wgfzr9xpw))
- When a な-adjective is used directly before a noun, you need to use な directly after the adjective. な is what attaches the adjective to the noun, forming a short noun phrase. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jw0fxpevaw6fwh0q2d3kvhj1))
- In addition to their ability to describe nouns, some な-adjectives can be used as nouns themselves ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jw0g19a0xsh313kmg757y4qt))
- These nouns refer to abstract concepts, like “safety” (安全), “peace” (平和), or “freedom” (自由). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jw0g30rw63xj0eer3ejeyt1s))
- Combined with the [particle に](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/particle-ni), some な-adjectives can also be used as adverbs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jw0g3b7h9ty3499x970wyrzn))

- If you’re not sure whether an adjective is an い-adjective or な-adjective, check how it’s written in kanji. Unlike い-adjectives, the final 〜い of these な-adjectives is not in hiragana. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jwqhw717nz7nykheak6jr6y8))
