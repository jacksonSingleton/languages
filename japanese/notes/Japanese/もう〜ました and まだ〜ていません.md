# もう〜ました
---

- Can be used to talk about a past event that still has an effect at present, the English equivalent being something like "have already done"

> [!example]
> 昨日宿題をしました　ー　 *I did the homework yesterday*
> もう宿題をしました　ー　 *I have **already** done the homework*

# まだ〜ていません
---
- Using the negative in the past, the period must be complete. If you want to talk about how things stand currently, you should use ている instead

> [!example]
> 昨日宿題をしませんでした　ー　*I did not do the homework yesterday*
> まだ宿題をしていいません　ー　*I have not done the homework yet*


> [!important]
Positive: もう〜しました → *I have already X*
Negative: まだ〜ていません → *I have not X yet*
